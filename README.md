# js-trex-run

A browser game built in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  

Based on [Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania/)'s [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnkimGiEkb4).  

I've modified the physics and game speed and intend to modify the game more in the future.  

If you want to play then it is live [here](https://brendangasparin.github.io/js-dinosaur-run/).
